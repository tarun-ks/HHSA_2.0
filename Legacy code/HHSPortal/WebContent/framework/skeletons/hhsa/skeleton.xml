<!-- The "bighorn" skeleton is intended to be used as the new basis for custom 
	skeleton development, replacing the existing "default", "classic" and "text" 
	skeletons. This skeleton has several improvements over the existing skeletons, 
	including: 1) Cleaner skeleton files which generally favor JSTL and EL over 
	scriptlet 2) The use of JSP Documents which allow for more efficient development 
	and rendering 3) A new rendering model which combines the previous begin/end 
	phases into a single logical rendering phase This skeleton is designed to 
	be valid in accordance with the HTML 4.01 Transitional DTD. Unlike previous 
	skeletons, this skeleton provides CSS-based solutions for two of the three 
	layouts, namely flow and border. The grid layout continues to use table-based 
	solutions for both backward compatiblity and as an alternative for the CSS-based 
	layouts. This skeleton includes a single CSS file containing styles for use 
	with the CSS-based layouts. A few simple event handlers are also provided 
	for the float and delete titlebar buttons which provide hooks for custom 
	skin behavior. Some simple Javascript DOM utility functions are also provided 
	for use by skin authors (and which are used by the "bighorn" skins). -->
